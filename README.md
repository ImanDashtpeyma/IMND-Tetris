# IMND-Tetris
 Final Project
 A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares connected orthogonally (i.e., at the edges and not the corners).[1][2] Tetrominoes, like dominoes and pentominoes, are a particular type of polyomino. The corresponding polycube, called a tetracube, is a geometric shape composed of four cubes connected orthogonally.
